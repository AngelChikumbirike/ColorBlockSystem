# ColorBlockSystem
This assignment was mainly based on testing the communication skills of the programming expert to be able to work with a user who might not have any programming skills but expects a certain task to be completed. The experts role was to communicate with the client and help them come up with a "more reasonable" and feasible system than originally requested.
